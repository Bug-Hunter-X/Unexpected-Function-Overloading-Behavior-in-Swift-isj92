# Swift Function Overloading Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with function overloading in Swift where the compiler allows functions with the same name but different return types.  While technically legal, this can lead to subtle bugs due to implicit type conversions or unexpected function calls if the type is not explicitly specified.

The `bug.swift` file shows an example of this situation where two functions, `calculateArea`, exist with identical parameter names but different return types (`Double` and `Int`).  Depending on the context, the compiler may choose one or the other, leading to unexpected behavior that is difficult to debug without carefully inspecting the code.

The `bugSolution.swift` offers a recommended solution to avoid this ambiguity and improve code clarity and maintainability.
