To avoid this potential issue, it's recommended to use distinct function names when working with functions that have different return types, even if their purpose is similar. This enhances code clarity and prevents the compiler from making ambiguous choices.

For example, instead of using overloaded functions with different return types, consider:

```swift
func calculateAreaDouble(width: Double, height: Double) -> Double {
    return width * height
}

func calculateAreaInt(width: Int, height: Int) -> Int {
    return width * height
}

let areaDouble = calculateAreaDouble(width: 10.5, height: 5.2)
print(areaDouble) // Output: 54.6

let areaInt = calculateAreaInt(width: 10, height: 5)
print(areaInt) // Output: 50
```

This approach avoids ambiguity and enhances code readability, making it significantly easier to maintain and debug.
